# Apple Leaf Disease Detection

## Description

This project aims to develop a system for detecting diseases in apple leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main objective is to train the CNN to recognize different diseases from images of apple leaves. By doing so, the model will be able to identify diseased leaves when presented with new images that it has not seen before.


The process involves gathering images of healthy and diseased apple leaves, using these images to train the CNN, and then testing the model's ability to classify new leaf images accurately. The successful implementation of this project could be useful in practical applications, such as helping farmers quickly diagnose leaf diseases.
